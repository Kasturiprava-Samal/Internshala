      <u><i>About the Cuisines:</i></u>
    </h4>
    <p>
      The cuisine of New York City comprises many cuisines belonging to various
      ethnic groups that have entered the United States through the city. Almost
      all ethnic cuisines are well represented in New York, both within and
      outside the various ethnic neighborhoods. The city's New York Restaurant
      Week started in 1992 and has spread around the world due to the discounted
      prices that such a deal offers. In New York there are over 12,000 bodegas,
      delis, and groceries, and many among them are open 24 hours a day, 7 days
      a week. A good portion of the cuisine usually associated with New York
      stems in part from its large community of Ashkenazi Jews and their
      descendants. The world-famous New York institution of the delicatessen,
      commonly referred to as a "deli," was originally an institution of the
      city's Jewry.Much of New York's Jewish fare, predominantlybased on
      Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, has become popular around the globe, especially
      bagels.New York City's Jewish community is also famously fond of Chinese
      food, and many members of this community think of it as their second
      ethnic cuisine.
