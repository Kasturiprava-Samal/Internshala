      New York City traces its origins to Fort Amsterdam a trading post founded
      on the southern tip of Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists in
      approximately 1624. The settlement was named New Amsterdam (Dutch: Nieuw
      Amsterdam) in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653. The city came
      under British control in 1664 and was renamed New York after King Charles
      II granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York.[22] The city was
      temporarily regained by the Dutch in July 1673 and was renamed New Orange;
      however, the city has been named New York since November 1674. New York
      City was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790.[23] The
      modern city was formed by the 1898 consolidation of its five boroughs:
      Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island, and has been
      the largest U.S. city ever since.

      Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New
      York City has been called both the world's leading financial and fintech
      center and the most economically powerful city in the world.[26] It is
      home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by market capitalization
      of their listed companies: the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. As of
      2022, the New York metropolitan area is the largest metropolitan economy
      in the world with a gross metropolitan product of over US$2.16 trillion.
      If the New York metropolitan area were its own country, it would have the
      tenth-largest economy in the world. New York City is an established haven
      for global investors. As of 2023, New York City is the most expensive city
      in the world for expatriates to live. New York City is home to the highest
      number of billionaires, individuals of ultra-high net worth (greater than
      US$30 million), and millionaires of any city in the world.

      In the pre-Columbian era, the area of present-day New York City was
      inhabited by Algonquians, including the Lenape. Their homeland, known as
      Lenapehoking, included the present-day areas of Staten Island, Manhattan,
      the Bronx, the western portion of Long Island (including Brooklyn and
      Queens), and the Lower Hudson Valley.

      In 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson rediscovered New York Harbor
      while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for the Dutch East
      India Company. He proceeded to sail up what the Dutch would name the North
      River (now the Hudson River), named first by Hudson as the Mauritius after
      Maurice, Prince of Orange. Hudson's first mate described the harbor as "a
      very good Harbour for all windes" and the river as "a mile broad" and
      "full of fish".

      The first documented visit to New York Harbor by a European was in 1524 by
      Giovanni da Verrazzano, an explorer from Florence in the service of the
      French crown. He claimed the area for France and named it Nouvelle
      Angoulême (New Angoulême). A Spanish expedition, led by the Portuguese
      captain Estêvão Gomes sailing for Emperor Charles V, arrived in New York
      Harbor in January 1525 and charted the mouth of the Hudson River, which he
      named Río de San Antonio ('Saint Anthony's River').
